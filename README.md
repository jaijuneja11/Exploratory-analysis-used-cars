# Exploratory Data Analysis on Used Cars Dataset

This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a used cars dataset to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and prepare the data for potential predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

##  Dataset Description

- **Source**: [User-provided CSV]
- **File Name**: `used_cars_data.csv`
- **Rows**: ~7,000+
- **Columns**: 
  - `name`: Name of the car
  - `year`: Manufacturing year
  - `selling_price`: Price at which the car is being sold
  - `km_driven`: Kilometers driven
  - `fuel`: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, etc.)
  - `seller_type`: Type of seller (Individual, Dealer, etc.)
  - `transmission`: Transmission type (Manual, Automatic)
  - `owner`: Ownership status (First owner, Second owner, etc.)
  - `mileage`, `engine`, `max_power`: Performance specs
  - `seats`: Number of seats

##  Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the data (handle nulls, inconsistent values, data types).
- Explore univariate and bivariate relationships.
- Visualize key trends and distributions.
- Identify correlations between variables like price and other car attributes.
- Draw business insights from the data patterns.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** (v3.8+)
- **Pandas** â€“ data manipulation
- **NumPy** â€“ numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ interactive coding

## Key Insights

- Average selling price varies significantly with year, fuel type, and transmission.
- Cars with lower km driven and higher mileage generally fetch better prices.
- Diesel cars tend to have higher power and are preferred in some seller categories.
